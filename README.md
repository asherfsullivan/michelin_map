# Michelin Map

## Introduction

### Purpose
We all like high quality food, and are curious about possible relationships between Yelp ratings and Michelin star designations.

### Questions
- Can Yelp data and reviews help predict whether a restaurant has a Michelin star? Can we predict the # of Michelin stars a restaurant has by looking at their rating and/or review count from Yelp? 
- Using machine learning, can we predict which restaurants have gained a Michelin star since 2019? Can we predict into the future? 

## Data

### Source Data
We evaluated several existing datasets for Yelp restaurant review data and Michelin star restaurant data. Scraped data from Yelp to supplement found datasets.

Yelp data:
- [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset?select=yelp_academic_dataset_business.json)
- Scraped Yelp reviews using BeautifulSoup

Michelin data:
- [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackywang529/michelin-restaurants) with Michelin restaurants from 2019

### Data Cleaning
Initially created a small dataset of 83 restaurants in California with Michelin stars merged with their Yelp data, and then expanded data set to additional regions.
