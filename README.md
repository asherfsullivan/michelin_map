# Michelin Map

## Introduction

### Purpose
As a group we all like high quality food, and are curious about possible relationships between Yelp ratings and Michelin star designations.

### Questions
- Can Yelp data and reviews help predict whether a restaurant has a Michelin star? Can we predict the number of Michelin stars a restaurant has by looking at their rating and/or review count from Yelp? 
- Using machine learning, can we predict which restaurants have gained a Michelin star since 2019? Can we predict into the future? 

## Data

### Source Data
We evaluated several existing datasets for Yelp restaurant review data and Michelin star restaurant data. We used the following datasets, and scraped data from Yelp to supplement.
- Yelp data: [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset?select=yelp_academic_dataset_business.json)
- Michelin data: [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackywang529/michelin-restaurants) with Michelin restaurants from 2019

### Data Cleaning
We initially created a small cleaned dataset of 83 Michelin star restaurants in California, merged with their Yelp data. We then expanded the dataset to include restaurants in additional regions.
